# Introduction
The California Dataset is from the 1990 census. The dataset has 10 features with 20,640 instances. 

This project focuses heavily on the preperation portion of the dataset. The Boston Housing project is an end-to-end project in which I choose a model and fine-tune it.

This project uses Chapter 2 in "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow" as a basis for the data cleansing. 

This project focuses on the following steps of a machine learning project:
  - Filling in null values 
  - Converting categorical attributes into numerical values
  - Feature scaling
  - Attribute combination
  - Transformation pipelines
  

# Description
| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `longitude` | A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west |
| `latitude` | A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north |
| `housing_median_age` | Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building |
| `total_rooms` | Total number of rooms within a block |
| `total_bedrooms` | Total number of bedrooms within a block |
| `population` | Total number of people residing within a block |
| `households` | Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block |
| `median_income` | Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars) |
| `median_house_value` | Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars) |
| `ocean_proximity` | Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea |
