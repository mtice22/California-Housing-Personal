# Introduction
The California Dataset is from the 1990 census. The dataset has 10 features with 20,640 instances. 

This project focuses heavily on the preperation portion of the dataset. The Boston Housing project is an end-to-end project in which I choose a model and fine-tune it. 

This project includes the following steps of a machine learning project:

# Description
